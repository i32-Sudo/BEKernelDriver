# BEKernelDriver
 An Undetected BE Kernel Driver I developed, Will probably be detected upon releasing this but can be made undetected very easily.
 This can also work for EAC But you will need to use a dif mapper as GDRV Pages are scanned by EAC and you will also need to add a CR3 Bypass.
# 内核驱动
我开发的一个未被检测到的BE内核驱动，发布后可能会被检测到，但可以很容易地使其未被检测到。这也可以用于EAC，但你需要使用不同的映射器，因为EAC会扫描GDRV页，你还需要添加一个CR3绕过。
